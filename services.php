              <h4>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</h4>
              <p>Women and girls, everywhere, must have equal rights and opportunity, and be able to live free of violence and discrimination. Women’s equality and empowerment is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but also integral to all dimensions of inclusive and sustainable development. In short, all the SDGs depend on the achievement of Goal.

49 countries lack laws protecting women from domestic violence. 
Gender equality by 2030 requires urgent action to eliminate the many root causes of discrimination that still curtail women’s rights in private and public spheres. For example, discriminatory laws need to change and legislation adopted to proactively advance equality. Yet 49 countries still lack laws protecting women from domestic violence, while 39 bar equal inheritance rights for daughters and sons. Eliminating gender-based violence is a priority, given that this is one of the most pervasive human rights violations in the world today. Based on data from 87 countries, 1 in 5 women and girls under the age of 50 will have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner within the last 12 months. Harmful practices, such as child marriage, steal the childhood of 15 million girls under age 18 every year.

              <h4>Reduce inequality within and among countries</h4>
              <p>We call for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on sex, age, disability, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity – both within and among countries. World leaders recognized the positive contribution of international migration to inclusive growth and sustainable development, while acknowledging that it demands coherent and comprehensive responses. Accordingly, they committed to cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration. The Goal also addresses issues related to representation and development assistance.

              <h4>Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels</h4>
              <p>Business thrives in peaceful environments with effective institutions where operating costs are predictable and working environments are stable. Failure to implement responsible business practices can result in additional costs and risks (financial, legal, reputational) to the business itself, and, can exacerbate tensions and instability in society and undermine the rule of law. Corruption causes inefficiencies in markets because it renders transaction costs uncertain, is anti-competitive, and hampers businesses’ ability to comply with human rights and other obligations.
